# Welcome to the Self Serving Kiosk Terminal Application

## steps to install the application

**Operating the Self-Serving Kiosk Terminal Application**

1. **Open a Terminal Window:**
   - On your computer, open a terminal window. This can typically be done through your operating system's search or application launcher.

2. **Navigate to the Application Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the `RUN_SSKiosk.sh` script is located. For example:
     ```bash
     cd ./GustavoJimenez_T1A3/src
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the following command to run the self-serving kiosk application:
     ```bash
     ./RUN_SSKiosk.sh
     ```

4. **Script Execution:**
   - The script will perform the following actions:
     - **Check Python Installation:**
       - Verify if Python is installed on your system.
       - If Python is not installed, the script will exit with an error message prompting you to install Python.
     - **Check venv Installation:**
       - Confirm the availability of the `venv` module.
       - If `venv` is not installed, the script will exit with an error message providing guidance on installation.
     - **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
       - Create a virtual environment named `.kiosk` using `python3 -m venv .kiosk`.
       - Activate the virtual environment using `source .kiosk/bin/activate`.
     - **Install Dependencies:**
       - Install Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
     - **Run the Kiosk Application:**
       - Execute the self-serving kiosk application by running `python3 ordering_kiosk.py`.
     - **Deactivate Virtual Environment:**
       - Deactivate the virtual environment after the application completes running by using the `deactivate` command.

5. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter any issues during the script execution, carefully read the error messages for guidance on resolution.
   - Additionally, refer to the following resources for help:
     - [Official virtualenv Documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)
     - [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

6. **Enjoy Your Kiosk Experience:**
   - Once the script has successfully executed, enjoy using the self-serving kiosk application for your needs.


### Dependencies required by the application to operate

    about-time==4.2.1  
    alive-progress==3.1.5  
    grapheme==0.6.0  
    markdown-it-py==3.0.0  
    mdurl==0.1.2  
    Pygments==2.17.2

    pytest==7.4.3

### Any system/hardware requirements

Your provided system and hardware requirements for running a basic Python terminal application are quite reasonable. However, let's break it down further and add more specificity:

#### System Requirements:

**Operating System:**
- Windows 10, macOS, or Linux

**Python Version:**
- Python 3.2 and above

**Python Package:**
- `virtualenv` package installed

#### Hardware Requirements:

**Processor:**
- Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3

**Memory (RAM):**
- 4 GB RAM

**Storage:**
- 256 GB SSD

**Display:**
- Minimum resolution of 1366 x 768

#### Additional Considerations:

- **Disk Space:** Ensure that there is sufficient free disk space to accommodate the Python interpreter, virtual environments, and any additional dependencies or datasets your application may require.

- **Internet Connection:** While not explicitly mentioned, an internet connection may be necessary during the initial setup or when installing Python packages.

- **GPU:** For basic terminal applications, a dedicated GPU is not a strict requirement. However, if you are working with computationally intensive applications or large datasets that can benefit from GPU acceleration, consider having a compatible GPU.

- **Environmental Variables:** Make sure that the necessary environmental variables are set up correctly, especially those related to Python and virtual environments.

- **Terminal Emulator:** Ensure that the operating system has a functional terminal emulator. On Windows, this could be Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a third-party terminal emulator like Git Bash. On macOS and Linux, the default terminal applications should be sufficient.

#### Recommendations:

- Regularly update the operating system, Python, and installed packages to benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security patches.

- When working with Python, consider using a version manager like `pyenv` (on macOS/Linux) or `pyenv-win` (on Windows) to manage different Python versions.

- If you plan to deploy your application on various platforms, test it on each to ensure compatibility.

These specifications should be suitable for running this terminal application.
